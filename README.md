Flocking Simulator
==================
A Javascript demonstration of "birds" either flocking around a changing random target or, using a mouse click, toggle to flocking around the cursor.

Some things that I would like to add:
* Text Boxes to view / change various variables that affect the birds behaviors
* Color based on direction maybe

A working demonstration can be viewed at http://alex-pope.github.com/flocking/.
