Flocking
========
A mostly complete javascript demo of "birds" either flocking around a changing random target or with a mouse click, toggle to flocking around the cursor.

Some things that I would like to add:
- Text Boxes to view / change various variables that affect the birds behaviors
- Color based on direction maybe

A working demo can be viewed here: http://jsfiddle.net/XwnJC/10/
